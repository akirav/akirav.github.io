The first four languages I learned were english, japanese, C, and C++. After hearing that I would have to learn JavaScript, I was quite hesitant because I thought that it would be very similar to Java and that I would have to learn new syntax. However, that was not the case. After completing the “Basic JavaScript” module on freeCodeCamp and watching Professor Johnson’s “7 reasons why JavaScript is better than Java and C++” video, it gave me a whole new appreciation for the language.  JavaScript is not a foreign language to me because the syntax is very similar to C/C++. However, readability and usability of JavaScript makes much more sense then the first four languages I have learned.

From a software engineering perspective, I believe that JavaScript is a good language. Some pros to JavaScript include: storing different data types in the same array, variable and function declarations do not require the specification of the data type, and the list goes on. But I still do believe that learning the traditional languages (C,C++, and/or Java) first can help with learning the fundamentals of programming. Coming from a computer engineering perspective, I believe that Javascript is a bad language that does not allow the programmer to understand the low-level workings of a computer. Either way, all programming languages have their pros and cons.

Athletic software engineering is a great pedagogy that allows students to learn JavaScript in no time. I believe that the practice WODs will help me prepare for technical interviews. WODs can be stressful in the beginning, but when time goes on it will eventually become easy.
