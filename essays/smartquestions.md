Let's be honest here, the article <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">"How to ask questions the smart way"</a> by Eric Steven Raymond is a great article that provides guidelines to asking "smart questions," but it is very long. There are three main steps to help you make a "regular" question into a "smart question." First, we must make sure that your questions is unique. There are a million other programmers who may have asked for help with a similar problem. If you are unable to find the answers to your problem, choose the correct forum/place to ask the question. These forums/places include stackoverflow, classmates, and maybe even the professor. Now that you have chosen the correct forum, we must make sure that your question is precise and informative. In your question give background information of the problem. Make sure to describe the problem, the research done, and the steps you have done in attempt to solve the problem.
