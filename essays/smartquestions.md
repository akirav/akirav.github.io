Let's be honest here, the article <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">"How to ask questions the smart way"</a> by Eric Steven Raymond is a great article that provides guidelines to asking "smart questions," but it is very long. There are three main steps to help you make a "regular" question into a "smart question." First, we must make sure that your questions is unique. There are a million other programmers who may have asked for help with a similar problem. If you are unable to find the answers to your problem, choose the correct forum/place to ask the question. These forums/places include stackoverflow, classmates, and maybe even the professor. Now that you have chosen the correct forum, we must make sure that your question is precise and informative. In your question give background information of the problem. Make sure to describe the problem, the research done, and the steps you have done in attempt to solve the problem.

Joey Tribbiani would ask <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34733505/how-to-print-to-console-using-javascript">this</a> question if he was a Software Engineer. Joey Tribbiani who just started learning JavaScript asked a very important question, "How to print to console using javascript?" Joey even also gave a description of the problem and some research done. A quick and simple google search of the problem will lead you to a similar question that was answered eight years before Joey's post. What makes this question "stupid" is that Joey spent more time asking the question on stackoverflow rather than further researching the problem. If Joey spent more time researching, he would not have to wait for someone to answer his question.
