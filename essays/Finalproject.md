The Problem:
College Students love to drink at parties and may need to find a DD "Designated Driver" and are to broke to call an Uber. There is no simple way to ask everyone at the party who is a DD

The Solution:
The UHM-DD application will provide a centralized directory for UH Manoa DD and drinkers. UH Manoa students can login to browse a well organized directory of all current students at the party, with brief descriptions, and meeting times and locations.


Case Ideas:
New User goes to landing page. Selects a party and the determines if they need a DD or is a DD.
DD and People who need DD will connect and will receive there numbers and etc.
Users can request to create a party and an admin can approve

Beyond the Basic
Support a network of “who’s driven who”.
Support reviews of DD.
Use UH CAS Login instead of Meteor Login to guarantee that users are UH students.
Map-based interface to indicate where the DD's and Drunks are.
Provides activity feed
Notify students via email, twitter, SMS when DD is ready to leave.
Text message interface. See notifications, and reply to confirm attendance all through text message.
