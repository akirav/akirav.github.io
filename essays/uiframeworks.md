UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

For this assignment, create an engaging and informative essay about UI Frameworks. You might want to discuss some of the issues raised above, as well as your own personal experience with Semantic UI. Or perhaps youâ€™ve also used another framework such as Twitter Bootstrap. In that case, it might be interesting to read your perspective on a comparison of the two.

Just like the name entails, Semantic UI is a great framework for beginner due to its readability. Semantic UI utilizes natural language principals which allows users to create simple and/or complex layouts. A quick google search of "UI Frameworks", show several article where Semantic UI is ranked in the top five for the most popular front-end frameworks. The learning curve may be steep, but there are many resources such as articles and tutorials that can help you learn Semantic UI. It will truly take a lot of time to master Semantic UI, but it is worth it due to the many functionalities it offers.

Adding on to the fact that I am also learning html and css, learning Semantic UI is just as similar as learning your first programming language. There are times where you swear that the framework is broken, but in reality you missed putting a "ui" in one of your classes. And there are other times where you feel accomplished where you can create a section of your webpage with the many reusable components Semantic UI has to offer. So far my skills in Semantic UI are very limited, but as this class goes on my skills and knowledge in Semantic UI will allow me to develop complex web pages that are visually appealing.
