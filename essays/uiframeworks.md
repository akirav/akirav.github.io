Just like the name entails, Semantic UI is a great framework for beginner due to its readability. Semantic UI utilizes natural language principals which allows users to create simple and/or complex layouts. A quick google search of "UI Frameworks", show several article where Semantic UI is ranked in the top five for the most popular front-end frameworks. The learning curve may be steep, but there are many resources such as articles and tutorials that can help you learn Semantic UI. It will truly take a lot of time to master Semantic UI, but it is worth it due to the many functionalities it offers.

Adding on to the fact that I am also learning html and css, learning Semantic UI is just as similar as learning your first programming language. There are times where you swear that the framework is broken, but in reality you missed putting a "ui" in one of your classes. And there are other times where you feel accomplished where you can create a section of your webpage with the many reusable components Semantic UI has to offer. So far my skills in Semantic UI are very limited, but as this class goes on my skills and knowledge in Semantic UI will allow me to develop complex web pages that are visually appealing. The great poet ("rapper") J. Cole states that there is

"beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success." </a> This past week I struggled learning Semantic UI, but I am starting to get the hang of it.

Front end development with raw HTML and CSS is possible, but will waste your time. Semantic UI was created to provide components that are regularly used in websites such as buttons, grids, menus, and etc. Having access to these components will allow developers to save time ad focus on other parts of the website. Overall Semantic UI is a great framework that can be used by beginners and experts to create visually appealing webpages.
